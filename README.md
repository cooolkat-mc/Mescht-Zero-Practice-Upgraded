Simple upgrade to Mescht Zero Cycle Practice, adding ability to practice zero cycle setups without the dragon

How to use:

First time loading the world, run the command:

**`/function practice:practice_setup`**

after this, it should work properly and you never have to run it again. Just click the sign to toggle setup mode on or off.

Huge thanks to Mescht for making almost the entire map and here is the link to the original project:
